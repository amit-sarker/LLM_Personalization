# LLM_Personalization
This project focuses on improving the personalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by advancing the retrieval of user profile information. By using novel retrieval strategies, including clustering and reranking methods, this project aims to optimize LLM outputs to be more user-specific and contextually relevant.

The project focuses on the following research questions (RQs):

RQ1: How can relevant information be extracted from a user profile to personalize the output of a Large Language Model (LLM)?
RQ2: How can the prompt to personalize an LLM output be optimized when the relevant user information is large?
